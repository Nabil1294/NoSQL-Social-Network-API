## Description
This proof-of-concept application was developed to demonstrate the construction of a social network API. It fully supports all CRUD operations, including:

* Creation of user accounts
* Viewing of all user accounts
* Viewing of a specific user account
* Updating of user accounts
* Deletion of user accounts
* Addition of friends to user accounts
* Creation of "thoughts" (posts)
* Viewing of all thoughts
* Viewing of a specific thought
* Updating of thoughts
* Deletion of thoughts
* Creation of "reactions" (responses to thoughts)
* Deletion of reactions.

In addition to the above, the database stores extra information related to each user, thought, and reaction. For instance, for each user, it keeps track of their friends, friend count, and thoughts. Similarly, for each thought, it stores the user who posted it, the number of reactions it received, and the time it was created.
